I set up a Ko-Fi! If you would like to support me, please consider donating!

## Features
 - Time and date
 - Current media + progress bar
 - Even G1 glasses support
 - Upcoming calendar 
 - Battery stats
 - Siri shortcuts/AppIntents support for a few actions 
 - Current weather
 - glasses brightness


## This app is built from the ground up on Swift and SwiftUI, ideally as a replacement for the stock Even app
I mainly wanted to do this to familiarize myself with swift/swiftui and many frameworks, like 
 - EventKit
 - MediaPlayer
 - BLE Communication
 - CoreLocation


## I am working on this fully in my free time, so don't expect a regular update cycle
