## Features
 - Time and date
 - Current media + progress bar
 - Upcoming calendar events
## Possible future features
 - Maybe look into Apple Health stats/rings
 - Actual Even G1 glasses support (Don't have my glasses to test yet)

## This is a NATIVE Swift/SwiftUI app that will replace the built in Even Realities app for Even Realities G1 glasses
I mainly wanted to do this to familiarize myself with swift/swiftui and many frameworks, like 
 - EventKit
 - MediaPlayer
 - BLE Communication

## I am working on this fully in my free time, so don't expect a regular update cycle
