I set up a Ko-Fi! If you would like to support me, please consider donating!

## Features
 - Time and date
 - Current media + progress bar
 - Even G1 glasses support
 - Upcoming calendar 
 - Battery stats
 - Siri shortcuts/AppIntents support for a few actions 
 - Current weather, temp, and wind speed

## Possible future features
 - Notification mirroring
 - glasses brightness

## This is a NATIVE Swift/SwiftUI app that will replace the built in Even Realities app for Even Realities G1 glasses
I mainly wanted to do this to familiarize myself with swift/swiftui and many frameworks, like 
 - EventKit
 - MediaPlayer
 - BLE Communication
 - Notification management

## I am working on this fully in my free time, so don't expect a regular update cycle
