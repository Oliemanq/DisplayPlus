## This is a NATIVE Swift/SwiftUI app that will replace the built in Even Realities app for Even Realities G1 glasses
I mainly wanted to do this to familiarize myself with swift/swiftui and many frameworks, like 
 - EventKit
 - MediaPlayer
 - BLE Communication
 - Notification management

## I am working on this fully in my free time, so don't expect a regular update cycle
